======
Welcome! I am an NLP Scientist at Zalo AI at Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. I have been a researcher at UIT@NLP lab during my undergraduate degree at University of Information Technology. After receiving my bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer science, I have continued to do part-time research at this lab until now. In parallel, I have worked as an AI researcher at Zalo AI, Vietnam for 5+ years.

Research Interests
======
I‚Äôm passionate about building intelligent retrieval systems that can reason, generalize across modalities and languages, and interact with structured knowledge. My research focuses on two major directions: enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and exploring the intersection between Artificial Intelligence and Geography.

üîç Retrieval-Augmented Generation: I‚Äôm interested in advancing RAG systems to make retrieval more intelligent, interpretable, and adaptable to complex data types.

üìò Knowledge Graph Reasoning: Leveraging structured knowledge graphs to support logical reasoning and evidence chaining during retrieval.

üåê Multilingual & Multimodal Embedding: Designing unified embedding spaces for cross-language and cross-modal semantic search - enabling systems to search across text, images, and more.

üó∫Ô∏è AI and Geography: As a geography enthusiast, exploring the intersection between spatial intelligence and artificial intelligence.

üß≠ Spatial RAG & Geographic Question Answering: Developing systems that understand and retrieve geospatial information, enabling models to answer geography-based questions and reason over maps, locations, and spatial relationships.
I am happy to chat and discuss potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me via Email (phongdntvn@gmail.com).
